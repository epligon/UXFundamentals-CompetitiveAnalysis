Kickstarter
Strengths: Household name, large userbase already
Wide range of applications (new products, supporting community causes, artist patronage)
responsive design

Weaknesses:
Service provided is not immediately obvious.
web design, while visually pleasing, does not suit the content, and seems at odds with the style of the logo
audience unclear, limited and uneffective messaging

Opportunities:
Leverage activist/community applications
Better messaging/imagery to promote brand and product awareness
Identify audience groups and deploy targeted marketing
more lively web design to promote user engagement

Threats:
platform oversaturated with underfunded projects
funders' interests/expectations/engagement changing

Cohesive and visually pleasing web design
Service benefits are obvious
Unique User group (entrepreneurs) effectively targetted in addition to regular users 
Obvious calls to action
Relevant and interesting content
responsive design

Weaknesses:
Some navigation content difficult to find (would have expected product categories to be more obvious)

Opportunities:
leverage e-commerce aspects to create a better "shopping" experience
better information architecure to make browsing easier

Threats
Other competitor's copying features/benefits
transaction-focused platform putting pressure on sellers to drive perk costs down, resulting in underfunded projects

Threats
Market fatique towards oversaturation of "monthly subscription" products
competitor copying features or providing more feature-rich product
